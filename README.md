# monochrome-printer

This was a school project from 2020 where I built a leJOS (Lego Mindstorms) printer that could print monochrome images.

Dithering algorithms were used to process the image so that they could be depicted nicely with only two colors

This project was done before knew what github was, thus file structure is a bit scuffed.
