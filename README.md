# monochrome-printer

This was a school project from 2020 where I built a leJOS (Lego Mindstorms) printer that could print monochrome images.

Printer contains the jar file that is loaded into the Lego EV3 Brick.
Image Processing is a Java Swing applet that is used to select the image to be printed, image brightness, and what dithering algorithm to use. 

This project was done before I knew how to do proper file structure.
